                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2024 Jaytirth Kundan <joy0094@proton.me>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                       Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.  This version of the License
is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for
all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and
use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you are informed
that you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
rights that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so
they know their rights.

  Developers that use the GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute, and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' sake, the GPL ensures that all
other developers also share these freedoms.  For the users' sake, it
ensures that every user is equally free to share and change all
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all
its users.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and
modification follow.

                     TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

  “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and
“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

  To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of it
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making
of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version”
of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

  A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a modified
version. 
  A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a covered work.

  “You” and “your” refer to the individual or entity exercising this
License.

  “Source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form
of a work.

  “Distribution” means making available to the general public a copy
of the Program or a covered work, whether for a fee or for free.
  “Convey” means to make available to the public, with or without
the intention of making a profit. 
  A “secondary license” is a license that permits you to convey a
covered work under different terms.

  1. Source Code.

  The Program must include a copy of this License and the source code
of the Program, in one of the following ways:
  a. The Program must be available to everyone under the same terms
as this License, along with a prominent notice stating that the
Program is licensed under the GPL.
  b. The Program must be available to everyone under this License
in its entirety, including its source code. This means that if you
distribute a binary version of the Program, you must also provide
access to its source code, either by including it in the same
distribution or by providing a written offer to obtain the source code
for a period of at least three years.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  You may copy, distribute and modify the Program as long as you
conform to the terms of this License. In particular, you must:
  a. Keep intact all copyright notices for the Program.
  b. Distribute copies of the Program so that everyone else can
get the same permissions you received. 
  c. In case you modify the Program, you must keep all notices
in the Program that inform everyone else of the license terms.
  d. Keep intact all copyright notices and other information
about who provided the Program to you.
  e. Ensure that everyone who receives a copy of the Program can
also receive the source code.

  3. Copyleft.

  You must distribute your modified version under the same License as
the original Program. If you do not distribute the Program in this
manner, you must cease to use and distribute it.

  4. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may distribute the Program in non-source form, provided that you:
  a. Include a copy of this License in the distribution.
  b. Accompany it with a prominent notice stating that you have
modified the Program.
  c. Include a copy of the source code.

  5. Accepting the License.

  You accept this License by copying or distributing the Program.

  6. Termination.

  You may lose your license if you do not comply with the terms of this
License. However, if you cure the violation within 30 days after
you become aware of it, you will regain your license.

  7. Warranty Disclaimer.

  There is no warranty for the Program, and you are responsible for
any issues that may arise from your use of it.

  8. Limitation of Liability.

  Under no circumstances shall the author or copyright holders be liable
for any damage caused by the Program.

  9. Interpretation.

  This License shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of
the jurisdiction in which it was received.

  10. Final Acceptance.

  By copying, distributing, or modifying the Program, you indicate your
acceptance of this License and its terms.

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
